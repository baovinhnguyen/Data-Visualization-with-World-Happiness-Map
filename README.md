# Data-Visualization-with-World-Happiness-Map

This project is to perform data visualization on Python for World Happiness Map. First, I conducted data cleaning to normalize the data scale and filter N/A values. Second, I performed k-means clustering to cluster Happiness Score into 5 groups. Finally, I performed data visualization between different pairs of data, particularly between Happiness Score and Log GDP, Social Support, Healthy Life Expectancy At Birth, and Perceptions Of Corruption. By visual inspection, happiness score is strongly & positively correlated to the first 3 parameters and strongly & negatively correlated to the last parameter.
